# Success
**Assignment:**
Make a submission using Markdown, and share which attributes in this checkpoint or in the blog post that you will naturally be good at and which traits you will need to improve.

## Strengths
### 1. Learning to Forage
Being an information addict, I have always been a scavanger for information on the internet. Whether it is a topic I read in a random article or something someone mentioned to me in a conversation. I think my curiosity and hunger to know more has been my driving force to learn more about that topic. Hence, my information scavanging skills is a strength I am confident will aid in my quest for knowledge.

### 2. Commit the time
I love making lists; planning the day, the week, the year. However, not being at the extreme end of the _Type-A planner_ spectrum has it's pros and cons. Hence, there are some days where I take a longer "break" than it is advised. But this also means, due to my planning I know where I am in my schedule and what I need to do to make up if this happens. 

### 3. Mentorship
Mentorship was one of the key factors for me to chose BLOC.IO. I thrive on direction from mentors and those more experienced in the field. Although, I prefer to set my schedules and work independently, I believe as a new comer in this field guidance is extremely important so that the efforts made are in the right direction and hence leads towards success.

#### 4. Accept the assignments and projects produced by Bloc.
Since I thrive on guidance, I intend to this to the best of my ability. 

## Improvement Arenas

### 1. Avoid Lulls
See 
> Strengths, Item 2: Commit the time

### 2.Utilize all aspects of the program provided.
I have full intention to make sure I do not miss any aspects of the program. However, it would definitely be an arena where I would like to put more effort. Knowing that the student help team is an email away is definitely helpful in this aspect.
